# faux &emsp; [![Latest Version]][crates.io] [![rustc 1.51+]][Rust 1.51] [![docs]][api docs] ![][build]

A library to create [mocks] out of structs.

`faux` allows you to mock the methods of structs for testing without
complicating or polluting your code.

See the [API docs] for more information.

## Getting Started

`faux` makes liberal use of unsafe Rust features, so it is only
recommended for use inside tests. To prevent `faux` from leaking into
your production code, set it as a `dev-dependency` in your
`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
faux = "^0.1"
```
`faux` provides two attributes:
* `#[create]`: transforms a struct into a mockable equivalent
* `#[methods]`: transforms the methods in an `impl` block into

Use Rust's `#[cfg_attr(...)]` to gate these attributes to the test
config only.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(test, faux::create)]
pub struct MyStructToMock { /* fields */ }

#[cfg_attr(test, faux::methods)]
impl MyStructToMock { /* methods to mock */ }
```

## Examples

```rust
mod client {
    // #[faux::create] makes a struct mockable and
    // generates an associated `faux` function
    // e.g., `UserClient::faux()` will create a a mock `UserClient` instance
    #[faux::create]
    pub struct UserClient { /* data of the client */ }

    #[derive(Clone)]
    pub struct User {
        pub name: String
    }

    // #[faux::methods ] makes every public method in the `impl` block mockable
    #[faux::methods]
    impl UserClient {
        pub fn fetch(&self, id: usize) -> User {
            // does some network calls that we rather not do in tests
            User { name: "".into() }
        }
    }
}

use crate::client::UserClient;

pub struct Service {
    client: UserClient,
}

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct UserData {
    pub id: usize,
    pub name: String,
}

impl Service {
    fn user_data(&self) -> UserData {
        let id = 3;
        let user = self.client.fetch(id);
        UserData { id, name: user.name }
    }
}

// A sample #[test] for Service that mocks the client::UserClient
fn main() {
    // create a mock of client::UserClient using `faux`
    let mut client = client::UserClient::faux();

    // mock fetch but only if the argument is 3
    // argument matchers are optional
    faux::when!(client.fetch(3))
        // stub the return value for this mock
        .then_return(client::User { name: "my user name".into() });

    // prepare the subject for your test using the mocked client
    let subject = Service { client };

    // assert that your subject returns the expected data
    let expected = UserData { id: 3, name: String::from("my user name") };
    assert_eq!(subject.user_data(), expected);
}
```

**Due to [constraints with rustdocs], the above example tests in
`main()` rather than a `#[test]` function. In real life, the faux
attributes should be gated to `#[cfg(test)]`.**

## Features
`faux` lets you mock the return value or implementation of:

* Async methods
* Trait methods
* Generic struct methods
* Methods with pointer self types (e.g., `self: Rc<Self>`)
* Methods in external modules (but not external crates).

`faux` also provides easy-to-use argument matchers.

## Interactions With Other Proc Macros

While `faux` makes no guarantees that it will work with other macro
libraries, it should "just" work. There are some caveats, however. For
a quick solution, try making the `faux` attributes (e.g.
`#[faux::methods]`) the first attribute.

### Explanation

If another `proc-macro` modifies the *signature* of a method before
`faux` does its macro expansion, then it could modify the signature
into something not supported by `faux`. Unfortunately, [the order of
proc macros is not specified]. However, in practice it *seems* to
expand top-down (tested in Rust 1.42).

```rust ignore
#[faux::create]
struct Foo { /*some items here */ }

#[faux::methods]
#[another_attribute]
impl Foo {
    /* some methods here */
}
```

In the snippet above, `#[faux::methods]` will expand first followed by
`#[another_attribute]`.`faux` is effectively ignoring the other macro
and expanding based on the code you wrote.

If `#[faux::methods]` performs its expansion after another macro has
modified the `impl` block, `#[faux::methods]` receives the expanded
code. This code might contain different method signatures than what
you originally wrote. Note that the other proc macro's expansion may
create code that `faux` cannot handle (e.g. explicit lifetimes).

For a concrete example, let's look at
[`async-trait`](https://github.com/dtolnay/async-trait). `async-trait` effectively converts:

```rust ignore
async fn run(&self, arg: Arg) -> Out {
    /* stuff inside */
}
```

```rust ignore
fn run<'async>(&'async self, arg: Arg) -> Pin<Box<dyn std::future::Future<Output = Out> + Send + 'async>> {
    /* crazier stuff inside */
}
```

Because `async-trait` adds explicit lifetimes to the method signature,
which `faux` cannot handle, having `async-trait` do its expansion
first breaks `faux`. Note that even if `faux` could handle explicit
lifetimes, our signature is now so unwieldy that it would make mocks
hard to work with. Because `async-trait` just wants an `async`
function signature, and `faux` does not modify function signatures, it
is okay for `faux` to expand first.

```rust ignore
#[faux::methods]
#[async_trait]
impl MyStruct for MyTrait {
    async fn run(&self, arg: Arg) -> Out {
        /* stuff inside */
    }
}
```

If you find a proc macro that `faux` cannot handle, please open an
issue to see if `faux` is doing something unexpected that conflicts
with that macro.

## Goal

`faux` was founded on the belief that traits with single
implementations are an undue burden and an unnecessary layer of
abstraction. Thus, `faux` does not rely on trait definitions for every
mocked object, which would pollute their function signatures with
either generics or trait objects. `faux` aims to create mocks out of
user-defined structs, avoiding extra production code that exists
solely for tests.

## Inspiration

This library was inspired by [mocktopus], a mocking library for
nightly Rust that lets you mock any function. Unlike mocktopus, `faux`
works on stable Rust and deliberately only allows for mocking public
methods in structs.
