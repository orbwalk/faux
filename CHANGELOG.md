# CHANGELOG

## NEXT

* Future-proof `InvocationMatcher`

### Breaking Change
* `InvocationMatcher`'s methods are now all marked as `#[doc(hidden)]`
  and the trait itself is sealed form external implementations such
  that any changes to it are not considered as further breaking
  changes. In practice there isn't much need to implement this trait
  so while this technically a breaking change I do not expect any real
  breaking chages.
* Minimum Stable Rust Version bumped to 1.51

## v0.1.5
* Be more explicit about stubbing vs mocking
* Fixed issue where faux was requiring MSRV 1.54.0 because of doctests

## v0.1.4
* Make sure `faux` is using the latest version of `faux_macros`

## v0.1.3
* Support mocking methods with arguments of type: `&impl Trait`
  * [test](/tests/generic_methods.rs)

## v0.1.2
* Fixes a bug that made tests either fail or segfault in release mode

## v0.1.1
* Adds support for methods to return a `Self` instance.
  * Before only associated functions (e.g., `Self::new`) would work
  * This allows you to mock a custom implementation of `Clone`
  * [test](/tests/return_self_method.rs)

## v0.1
* No api changes

## v0.0.10
* Allow autoderiving `Default` on structs tagged by `#[create]`
  * Only allowed if the real instance implements `Default`
* Add `pattern!` and `from_fn!` macros to create matchers out of
  patterns and functions respectively.
* Hide the internal structure of `Eq`, `Any`, and `EqAgainst`.
  * Their respective methods now return `impl ArgMatcher<Arg>` to help
    against breaking changes in the future.

### Breaking Change
* `Eq`, `EqAgainst`, and `Any` are now all internal to `faux`. This
  will help prevent against breaking changes in the future.

## v0.0.9
* `when!` allows for argument matching
  * requires the arguments to implement `Debug`
  * [test](/tests/when_arguments.rs)
* `When` has a new `with_args` method to specify argument matchers.
  * The preferred way to set argument matchers is using `when!` which
    proxies to this method
  * [test](/tests/with_args.rs)
* Handle concurrent calls to different method calls in the same mock instance
  * [test](/tests/threads.rs)
  * [PR](https://github.com/nrxus/faux/pull/36). Thanks a lot [@Wesmania](https://github.com/Wesmania)!
* Support for mocking the same method multiple times by doing a latest
  that matches approach

### Breaking Change
* `When` has more generic arguments
  * This is technically a breaking change but unlikely to affect you.
  * Do not rely on the type signature of `When` as it is subject to change.
* `WhenOnce` -> `when::Once`

## v0.0.8
* `then*` methods have been renamed to be more consisten with Rust patterns
* The safe `then` method now allows for non-static inputs.
* `then_do` was removed as the improvement on `then` made it unnecessary.

### Breaking Change
* `then` was renamed: `then_unchecked`
* `then_return` was renamed: `then_unchecked_return`
* `safe_then` was renamed: `then`
* `safe_then_return` was renamed: `then_return`
* `then_do` was removed

## v0.0.7
* Allow mocking of methods with a `Pin<P>` receiver.
  * This is limited to `P`s that are *not* nested: `Rc<Self>`,
    `Box<Self>`, `Arc<Self>`, `&Self`, and `&mut Self>`.
  * Setting `self_type` to `Pin` for the `create` and `methods` macro
    is still not supported.
  * [tests](/tests/arbitrary_self.rs)

### Breaking Change
* Minimum rust version changed to 1.45

## v0.0.6
* Removes `proc-macro-hack` dependency.
  * Starting on rust 1.45, function-like proc macros are allowed in
    statement expressions
* Allow autoderiving `Clone`.
  * It will panic when trying to clone a mocked instance but work as
    expected on real instances
  * [test](/tests/clone.rs)
* Added `then_do`
  * It explicitly avoids letting the user look at the input parameters
    such that it can be safe to use on methods with non-static
    arguments
* Added `then_return`
  * Allows users to easily and safely mock the return value of methods
    without using a closure

### Breaking Change
* Minimum rust version changed to 1.45

## v0.0.5
* Suppport `impl` arguments in mocked methods
  * [test](/tests/generic_methods.rs)

## v0.0.4
* Mocks can now be called an infinite number of times
  * [test](/tests/multi_mock.rs)
* Trait implementations may now be mocked
  * [tests](/tests/trait_impl.rs)
  * This is a very MVP release for the feature. A limitation that may
    be lifted in the future is that you may not have two methods with
    the same name, even if one is through a trait implementation.
* Better macro error messages
  * [PR](https://github.com/nrxus/faux/pull/23). Thanks a lot [@TedDriggs](https://github.com/TedDriggs)!
* `self: Box<Self>`, `self: Rc<Self>`, and `self: Arc<Self>` are now
  allowed in methods inside an impl blocked tagged by
  `#[methods]`. See the tests for what is possible with arbitrary self
  types.
  * [tests](/tests/arbitrary_self.rs)

### Breaking Change

* Specifying a path in `#[methods]` has changed from:
  `#[methods(path::to::mod)]` to `#[methods(path =
  "path::to::mod")]`. This is done to allow further current and future
  arguments to be passed to the attribute.
* The default behavior for mocks has changed to be active for multiple
  calls. As a result, now mocks only accept `FnMut` closures which
  cannot have environment data moved into. If your mocks used to
  depend on moving data into the closure for the mock, you can use the
  `once` method on `When` to go back to the old behavior.

## v0.0.3
*  Async methods may now be mocked
   * [tests](/tests/asynchronous.rs)
* Mocked structs may now contain generics
   * [tests](/tests/generic_struct.rs)
* Mocked impl blocks may now contain a path
   * Paths that contain `super` or `crate` have to use the
     `faux::methods(path)` syntax.
   * [tests](/tests/paths.rs)

## v0.0.2

* Made mocked structs respect Sync+Send+Debug.
   * This allows mocking structs that are enforced to be
     Sync/Send/Debug. This has a performance impact as we now used
     Mutex rather than RefCell for interor mutability. This is unideal
     and will be addressed in a future release.

### Breaking Change

* All closures used for mocking methods must now implement Send. This
  means that all of its captures variables need to implement
  Send. This is unideal but needed for now to be able to mock things
  like Rocket's request guards.

## v0.0.1

* Initial alpha release
